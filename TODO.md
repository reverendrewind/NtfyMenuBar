### üî¥ LOW PRIORITY - Limited Feasibility
*Features that are difficult or impossible with current ntfy API*

#### Topic Statistics - ‚ö†Ô∏è API Limitations
- [ ] ~~Subscriber count~~ *(Not available via HTTP API)*
- [ ] ~~Message count~~ *(Not available via HTTP API)*
- [ ] ~~Last activity timestamp~~ *(Not available via HTTP API)*

#### Server Statistics & Monitoring - ‚ùå Not Possible
- [ ] ~~Server health status indicator~~ *(CLI/admin only)*
- [ ] ~~Real-time message throughput graph~~ *(No API support)*
- [ ] ~~Active subscriber counts~~ *(Not exposed via API)*
- [ ] ~~Storage usage metrics~~ *(CLI/admin only)*
- [ ] ~~Uptime monitoring and history~~ *(No API support)*
- [ ] ~~Server version information~~ *(CLI only)*
- [ ] ~~Performance metrics (CPU, memory)~~ *(Not available)*

#### Server Configuration - ‚ùå Admin/CLI Only
- [ ] ~~View current server configuration~~ *(Requires server access)*
- [ ] ~~Modify server settings through API~~ *(Not supported)*
- [ ] ~~Backup server configurations~~ *(File system access required)*
- [ ] ~~Server maintenance mode toggle~~ *(CLI only)*

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (v2.4.0)
- **Notification Snoozing**: Complete implementation with 8 preset durations and custom branded icon

- **Bug Fixes**: Dashboard header display, snooze functionality, Swift 6 compatibility

### üéØ Next Priorities
1. **Custom notification actions** - Interactive notification buttons and responses
2. **Delete individual messages** - Message management capabilities (if API permits)
3. **Export to other services** - Integration with Slack, Discord, etc.
4. **Webhook forwarding** - Forward notifications to external services

### üìö Documentation & Testing
- [x] Proxmox VE integration guide *(Completed)*
- [ ] Video tutorials for setup
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide expansion
- [ ] Unit tests for new features
- [ ] Integration tests with mock ntfy server

## üìä Feasibility Analysis Summary

### Research Findings (January 2025)

After comprehensive research of ntfy's HTTP API capabilities, the following constraints were identified:

#### ‚úÖ **Available HTTP API Endpoints:**
- **Account Management**: Personal access token generation, password changes
- **Authentication**: Basic auth and Bearer tokens
- **Publishing/Subscribing**: Full message flow support

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited API Support:**
- **Message History**: Only cached messages accessible, no server-side search
- **Topic Management**: Basic operations only, no statistics
- **Token Management**: Generation available, but limited administrative controls

#### ‚ùå **No HTTP API Support:**
- **User Management**: All user operations are CLI-only (ntfy user commands)
- **Server Statistics**: Health, performance, storage metrics
- **Server Configuration**: All configuration is file-based
- **Topic Statistics**: Subscriber counts, message counts, activity timestamps
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time throughput, uptime tracking

#### üîß **CLI-Only Features:**
Most server administration requires CLI access:
- **User Management**: `ntfy user add/del/list/change-pass/change-role`
- Server configuration changes
- Database management and backups
- Performance monitoring
- System health checks

### Implementation Progress

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Completed**: Personal access token management, enhanced authentication, UI/UX improvements
**‚úÖ Phase 2 Completed**: Connection enhancements, message filtering, notification snoozing
**üîÑ Phase 3 In Progress**: Client-side message management (export functionality), system integrations

### Current Recommendation

Continue focus on **HIGH PRIORITY** and **MEDIUM PRIORITY** items that provide user value within ntfy's API constraints. Next development should prioritize:

1. **Do Not Disturb scheduling** - High user value, client-side implementation
2. **Message export functionality** - Medium priority, works with cached messages
3. **System integrations** - AppleScript and Shortcuts app support for automation
