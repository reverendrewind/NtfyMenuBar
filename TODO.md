## üìä Feasibility Analysis Summary

### Research Findings (January 2025)

After comprehensive research of ntfy's HTTP API capabilities, the following constraints were identified:

#### ‚úÖ **Available HTTP API Endpoints:**
- **Account Management**: Personal access token generation, password changes
- **Authentication**: Basic auth and Bearer tokens
- **Publishing/Subscribing**: Full message flow support

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited API Support:**
- **Message History**: Only cached messages accessible, no server-side search
- **Topic Management**: Basic operations only, no statistics
- **Token Management**: Generation available, but limited administrative controls

#### ‚ùå **No HTTP API Support:**
- **User Management**: All user operations are CLI-only (ntfy user commands)
- **Server Statistics**: Health, performance, storage metrics
- **Server Configuration**: All configuration is file-based
- **Topic Statistics**: Subscriber counts, message counts, activity timestamps
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time throughput, uptime tracking

#### üîß **CLI-Only Features:**
Most server administration requires CLI access:
- **User Management**: `ntfy user add/del/list/change-pass/change-role`
- Server configuration changes
- Database management and backups
- Performance monitoring
- System health checks

### Recommendation

Focus development on **HIGH PRIORITY** items that provide immediate user value and are technically feasible. The original TODO scope was overly ambitious given ntfy's API limitations. A more realistic approach would be:

1. **Phase 1**: Personal access token management and enhanced authentication
2. **Phase 2**: UI/UX improvements and connection enhancements
3. **Phase 3**: Client-side message management and multi-server support

**Note**: User management features were removed from the roadmap as ntfy only supports CLI-based user administration (`ntfy user` commands) with no HTTP API endpoints available.
