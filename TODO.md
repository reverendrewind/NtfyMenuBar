## üìä Feasibility Analysis Summary

### Research Findings (January 2025)

After comprehensive research of ntfy's HTTP API capabilities, the following constraints were identified:

#### ‚úÖ **Available HTTP API Endpoints:**
- **Account Management**: Personal access token generation, password changes
- **Authentication**: Basic auth and Bearer tokens
- **Publishing/Subscribing**: Full message flow support

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited API Support:**
- **Message History**: Only cached messages accessible, no server-side search
- **Topic Management**: Basic operations only, no statistics
- **Token Management**: Generation available, but limited administrative controls

#### ‚ùå **No HTTP API Support:**
- **User Management**: All user operations are CLI-only (ntfy user commands)
- **Server Statistics**: Health, performance, storage metrics
- **Server Configuration**: All configuration is file-based
- **Topic Statistics**: Subscriber counts, message counts, activity timestamps
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time throughput, uptime tracking

#### üîß **CLI-Only Features:**
Most server administration requires CLI access:
- **User Management**: `ntfy user add/del/list/change-pass/change-role`
- Server configuration changes
- Database management and backups
- Performance monitoring
- System health checks

### Implementation Progress

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Completed**: Personal access token management, enhanced authentication, UI/UX improvements
**‚úÖ Phase 2A Completed**: Complete SettingsView architectural refactoring with component extraction
**‚úÖ Phase 2B Completed**: Connection enhancements, message filtering, notification snoozing, DND scheduling
**‚úÖ Phase 2C Completed**: Archive management system, open source preparation, professional UI polish
**üîÑ Phase 3 In Progress**: System integrations (AppleScript, enhanced Shortcuts), advanced automation

### Current Recommendation

Continue focus on **HIGH PRIORITY** and **MEDIUM PRIORITY** items that provide user value within ntfy's API constraints. Next development should prioritize:

1. **AppleScript automation support** - macOS workflow integration
2. **Enhanced Shortcuts app integration** - Expand beyond basic intents for comprehensive automation
3. **System integrations** - Third-party service forwarding (Slack, Discord, webhooks)
